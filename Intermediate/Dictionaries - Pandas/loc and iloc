#With loc and iloc you can do practically any data selection operation on
#DataFrames you can think of. loc is label-based, which means that you have
#to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. iloc is
#integer index based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer index


# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.loc['JAP'])
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS','EG']])
print(cars.iloc[[1,6]])
