Use a for loop to add a new column, named COUNTRY, that contains a uppercase version of the country names in the "country" column.
You can use the string method upper() for this.


# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Code for loop that adds COUNTRY column
for lab,col in cars.iterrows():
    cars.loc[lab,"COUNTRY"]=col["country"].upper()


# Print cars
print(cars)
