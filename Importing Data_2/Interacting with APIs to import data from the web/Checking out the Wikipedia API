 We'll figure out how to find and extract information from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. 
 What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, that is, JSONs with
 JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries within dictionaries.


# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url=('https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza')

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data=r.json()

# Print the Wikipedia page extract
pizza_extract = json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']

print(pizza_extract)
