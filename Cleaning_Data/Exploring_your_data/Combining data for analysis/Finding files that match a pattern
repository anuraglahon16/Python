Import the glob module along with pandas (as its usual alias pd).
Write a pattern to match all .csv files.
Save all files that match the pattern using the glob() function within the glob module. That is, by using glob.glob().
Print the list of file names. This has been done for you.
Read the second file in csv_files (i.e., index 1) into a DataFrame called csv2.



# Import necessary modules
import glob
import pandas as pd

# Write the pattern: pattern
pattern = '*.csv'

# Save all file matches: csv_files
csv_files = glob.glob(pattern)

# Print the file names
print(csv_files)

# Load the second file into a DataFrame: csv2
csv2 = pd.read_csv(csv_files[1])

# Print the head of csv2
print(csv2.head())
